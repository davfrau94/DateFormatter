# 📅 Date Formatter

This is a **Date Formatter** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It was created as an exercise from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), as part of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification path.
The purpose of this project is to practice working with JavaScript’s built-in `Date` object, and to gain hands-on experience formatting dates in various ways.

## 🚀 Features

- Extracts and formats the current date
- Converts date inputs to readable formats (e.g., `DD/MM/YYYY`, `Month Day, Year`)
- Uses vanilla JavaScript (no libraries)
- Interactive UI for selecting and formatting dates
